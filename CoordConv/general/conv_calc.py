# Functions for calculating convnet receptive field sizes
# Can use, e.g., like this:
# rso = [(1,1,0)]                  Input layer receptive field size (1 pixel), stride (1 pixel), and offset (0 pixels)
# rso.append(receptive_calc_conv(5, 1)(rso[-1]))
# rso.append(receptive_calc_pool(2, 2)(rso[-1]))
# rso.append(receptive_calc_conv_same(5, 1)(rso[-1]))
# rso.append(receptive_calc_conv_same(5, 1)(rso[-1]))
# print rso
# [(1, 1, 0), (5, 1, 0), (6, 2, 0), (14, 2, -4), (22, 2, -8)]
# print rso[-1]
# (22, 2, -8)                      Output layer receptive field size (22 pixels), stride (2 pixels), and offset (-8 pixels)
